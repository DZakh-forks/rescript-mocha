## Unreleased

Before cutting a 1.0 version I'm planning to review the API and look at what is worth updating. ReScript best practices have changed a lot since `bs-mocha` was created 6 years ago.

## Released

### 0.10.0

Upgraded mocha to 10 and ReScript to 11.
Set `uncurried: false` in `bsconfig.json` for the moment. There is a `modern-api` branch that is more likely to support uncurried use; that's still in progress.

### 0.9.0

Initial release after rename; no changes. Just updated the mocha dependency to v9.
